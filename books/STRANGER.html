A Stranger in My Room

Noctivine

It all started on a Friday.

The same tired body…
and the memories of my broken love.

I thought, now I’ll start fresh.

I ate a little and went to bed.
I was so exhausted that I didn’t even realize when I fell asleep.

Then suddenly, my eyes opened.

I sat up.

I reached out to grab water from the table beside me…
and that’s when my eyes went to that corner of the room.

That same corner…
where I used to cry as a child.

There was a dark shadow there.

I looked carefully…
and saw a girl standing.

“Who are you?” I asked.

She didn’t say anything.
She just looked at me.

Her face was deeply sad.
But the moment I looked into her eyes…

a faint spark appeared.

“After so many years…” she said softly.
“Finally, you woke up.”

I asked again, “Who are you?”

She gave a small smile.
“Don’t you recognize me?”

As she said that, her expression changed…
like someone had poured cold water over my burned heart.

“I don’t know you,” I said.

Tears gathered in her eyes.
“Why would you remember…”

Then she said quietly,
“Come on… check your phone.”

My feet felt stuck to the ground.
But I don’t know why…

I listened to her.

I pressed the power button on my phone.

For a few seconds, everything seemed normal.
Then I noticed…

the wallpaper wasn’t mine.

And the time…

It was 2 AM.

I asked angrily, “Are you doing all this?”

“We,” she said.

Then she said something strange…
“Not me, Faizal… we.”

The moment she said my name…
a strange shiver ran through my entire body.

“My name…” I said softly.
“How do you know it?”

She looked into my eyes.

“What’s your name?” I asked.

She stayed silent for a moment, then said…
“What will you do after knowing my name?”

Then she said…
“I’m the one you kept searching for in everyone.”

“I don’t understand,” I said.

She held my hand…
and sat on the bed.

My body felt like it was moving on its own.
As if my will belonged to someone else.

She placed my head in her lap.
And gently ran her fingers through my hair.

Then she began to speak…

“It’s so hard, isn’t it…”
“When you put your entire world inside one person.”
“When you start seeing your future with them.”
“At first everything feels good…”
“Then slowly… everything gets taken away.”

She paused for a moment.

Then she said…
“In the happiness of meeting you…”
“I forgot the pain of being away from you.”
“How many times have I been separated from you…”
“How many times have I watched you break right in front of my eyes…”

And then, very softly, she said…
“Other than hope…”
“I couldn’t give you anything.”

I interrupted,
“Is all this a dream?”

She gave a faint laugh.
“Sometimes dreams…”
“are a million times better than reality.”

Then her voice grew heavier.
“But unfortunately…”
“this is reality.”

Hearing that, I started feeling sleepy.

The softness of her hands put me to sleep in her lap.

I don’t know who she was.

Had I met her before?

Why did everything about her feel so familiar?

And her words…
as if she was laying my past right in front of me.

Then suddenly, my eyes opened again.

I was still in her lap.

“You’re awake,” she said lovingly.

“Why isn’t it morning yet?” I asked.

“Morning…” she repeated.
“You want to wake up?”

“Yes,” I said.
“I have to go to college in the morning.”

She looked at me.
“You’ve forgotten everything,” she said softly.
“Remember… how you fell asleep.”

I got up from her lap and sat upright.

My hands and feet started trembling.

And suddenly I remembered…

To fall asleep…
I had taken all the sleeping pills at once.

An overdose.

That kills you, doesn’t it…
So how am I alive?

…

…

I remember…

The first time I got into a relationship was in high school.
It was teenage excitement.

Within a few months, my first love left me.

Everyone says first love never gets completed.
Mine didn’t either.

Maybe it could have…
maybe…

But I…
in trying to understand the beautiful body of a stranger,
I never truly understood myself.

In these five years, I’ve been in relationships twelve times.

Sometimes someone left me.
Sometimes someone betrayed me.

Every time, I felt like it was my fault.

Mine.

But the truth was…
I never really knew myself.

I kept searching for my “perfect partner” in all of them…
even though I didn’t even know who I was.

What I saw wasn’t love…
it was just need.

Comfort.
Understanding.
Acceptance.

A corner…
where no one judges you.

The whole world searches for that in a partner.

And so did I.

I got so trapped in red flags and green flags…
but maybe humans aren’t flags.

Situations can make a person do anything.

Make someone a hero.
Make someone a murderer.

And sometimes a person…
kills themselves with their own hands.

“Where did you go?” she asked lovingly.

I looked at her.
“When was the last time we met?”

She smiled faintly.
“I’ve met you many times…”

“But the first time…”
“I met you five years ago.”

“And a few months later, we got separated.”

“Where am I?” I asked.

She said…
“Where you probably should be.”

“By now… I should be dead,” I said softly.

She stayed quiet for a moment.

Then she said…
“Maybe you’re about to die.”

I panicked.
I started moving back.

She quickly said…
“Hey, don’t be scared.”
“I won’t kill you.”

Then she said…
“I’m the one…”
“you’ve been searching for these past five years.”

And in that moment…

I understood everything.

She placed my head in her lap again.
Ran her fingers through my hair.

And this time…

I truly fell asleep.

And this time, what Faizal wanted…
he got it.

If not while awake…
then at least while asleep.</pre>

      <!-- ✅ HINDI (UPDATED) -->
      <article class="story" id="storyHI" style="display:none;">
        <pre class="storyPre">ये सब शुक्रवार से शुरू हुआ।

वही थका हुआ शरीर…
और मेरे टूटे हुए प्यार की यादें।

मैंने सोचा, अब नई शुरुआत करूँगा।
थोड़ा सा खाना खाया और बिस्तर पर चला गया।
इतना थका था कि कब नींद आ गई, पता ही नहीं चला।

फिर अचानक मेरी आँख खुल गई।
मैं उठकर बैठ गया।

पास वाली टेबल से पानी उठाने के लिए हाथ बढ़ाया…
तभी मेरी नज़र उस कोने पर पड़ी।

वही कोना…
जहाँ मैं बचपन में रोया करता था।

वहाँ एक काली परछाईं थी।

मैंने ध्यान से देखा…
तो एक लड़की खड़ी थी।

“कौन हो तुम?” मैंने पूछा।

उसने कुछ नहीं कहा।
बस मेरी तरफ देखा।

उसका चेहरा बहुत उदास था।
लेकिन जैसे ही मैंने उसकी आँखों में देखा…
उसकी आँखों में हल्की सी चमक आ गई।

“इतने सालों बाद…” उसने धीमे से कहा।
“आखिरकार तुम जाग गए।”

मैंने फिर पूछा, “कौन हो तुम?”

वो हल्की सी मुस्कुराई।
“मुझे नहीं पहचाना?”

ये कहकर उसने ऐसा चेहरा बनाया…
जैसे मेरे जले हुए दिल पर किसी ने ठंडा पानी डाल दिया हो।

“मैं तुम्हें नहीं जानता,” मैंने कहा।

उसकी आँखों में आँसू आ गए।
“क्यों याद होगा…”

फिर उसने धीरे से कहा,
“चलो… अपना मोबाइल देखो।”

मेरे पैर जैसे चिपक गए थे।
पर पता नहीं क्यों…
मैंने उसकी बात मान ली।

मैंने मोबाइल का पावर बटन दबाया।

कुछ पल तक सब सामान्य लगा।
फिर मेरी नज़र गई…

वॉलपेपर मेरा नहीं था।

और समय…
सुबह के 2 बज रहे थे।

मैंने गुस्से में पूछा, “ये सब तुम कर रही हो?”

“हम,” उसने कहा।

फिर उसने एक अजीब सी बात बोली—
“मैं नहीं फैज़ल… हम।”

जैसे ही उसने मेरा नाम लिया…
मेरे पूरे शरीर में एक अजीब सी सिहरन दौड़ गई।

“मेरा नाम…” मैंने धीमे से कहा।
“तुम्हें कैसे पता?”

उसने मेरी आँखों में देखा।

“तुम्हारा नाम क्या है?” मैंने पूछा।

वो थोड़ी देर चुप रही, फिर बोली—
“नाम जानकर क्या करोगे?”

फिर बोली—
“मैं वो हूँ… जिसे तुम सब में ढूँढते रहे।”

“मैं समझा नहीं,” मैंने कहा।

उसने मेरा हाथ पकड़ा…
और बिस्तर पर बैठ गई।

मेरा शरीर जैसे अपने आप चल रहा था।
जैसे मेरी मर्ज़ी किसी और के पास हो।

उसने मेरा सिर अपनी गोद में रख लिया।
और हाथों से मेरे बाल सहलाने लगी।

फिर वो बोलने लगी—

“कितना मुश्किल होता है ना…”
“जब हम किसी इंसान में अपना पूरा संसार रख देते हैं।”
“उसके साथ अपना भविष्य देख लेते हैं।”
“पहले सब अच्छा लगता है…”
“फिर धीरे-धीरे सब छिन जाता है।”

वो थोड़ा रुकी।

फिर बोली—
“मैं तुमसे मिलने की खुशी में…”
“तुमसे दूर होने का गम भूल गई।”
“आखिर कितनी बार तुमसे अलग हुई हूँ…”
“कितनी बार तुम्हें अपनी आँखों के सामने टूटते देखा है…”

और फिर बहुत धीमे से बोली—
“उम्मीद के अलावा…”
“मैं तुम्हें कुछ नहीं दे पाई।”

मैंने बीच में कहा—
“क्या ये सब सपना है?”

वो हल्का सा हँसी।
“कई बार सपने…”
“हकीकत से लाख गुना अच्छे होते हैं।”

फिर उसकी आवाज़ और भारी हो गई।
“लेकिन अफसोस…”
“ये हकीकत है।”

इतना सुनते ही मुझे नींद आने लगी।
उसके हाथों की नरमी ने मुझे उसकी गोद में सुला दिया।

मैं नहीं जानता वो कौन थी।
क्या मैं उससे पहले मिल चुका था?
उसके साथ सब इतना जाना-पहचाना क्यों लग रहा था?
और उसकी बातें…
जैसे मेरा बीता हुआ वक्त मेरे सामने रख रही थीं।

फिर अचानक मेरी आँख फिर खुली।
मैं उसी की गोद में था।

“जाग गए तुम,” उसने प्यार से कहा।

“अभी तक सुबह क्यों नहीं हुई?” मैंने पूछा।

“सुबह…” उसने दोहराया।
“तुम जागना चाहते हो?”

“हाँ,” मैंने कहा।
“मुझे सुबह कॉलेज जाना है।”

उसने मेरी तरफ देखा।
“तुम सब भूल गए,” उसने धीरे से कहा।
“याद करो… तुम कैसे सोए थे।”

मैं उसकी गोद से उठकर बैठ गया।
मेरे हाथ-पैर काँपने लगे।

और एकदम से याद आया…

नींद आने के लिए…
मैंने सारी sleeping pills एक साथ खा ली थीं।

Overdose.

वो तो मार देता है ना…
तो मैं ज़िंदा कैसे हूँ?

……
……

मुझे याद है…
मैं पहली बार हाई स्कूल में रिश्ते में आया था।
टीनएज का जोश था।

कुछ महीनों में मेरा पहला प्यार मुझे छोड़ गई।

सब कहते हैं पहला प्यार पूरा नहीं होता।
मेरा भी नहीं हुआ।

शायद हो सकता था…
शायद…

लेकिन मैं…
मैं उस अनजान इंसान के खूबसूरत शरीर को समझने में
खुद को कभी समझ ही नहीं पाया।

इन 5 सालों में मैं 12 बार रिश्तों में आया।
कभी कोई मुझे छोड़कर चली गई।
कभी किसी ने धोखा दिया।

हर बार लगता था गलती मेरी ही थी।

मेरी।

पर सच ये था…
मैंने खुद को कभी जाना ही नहीं।

मैं उन सब में अपना “परफेक्ट पार्टनर” ढूँढता रहा…
जबकि मुझे खुद नहीं पता था मैं कौन हूँ।

जो दिखता था, वो प्यार नहीं…
सिर्फ जरूरत थी।

Comfort.
Understanding.
Acceptance.

वो कोना…
जहाँ कोई जज न करे।

ये दुनिया सब ढूँढती है अपने पार्टनर में।
और मैं भी।

मैं red flag, green flag में इतना फँस चुका था…
लेकिन शायद इंसान flag नहीं होता।

हालात इंसान से सब करवा देते हैं।

किसी को hero।
किसी को murderer।

और कभी-कभी इंसान…
अपने हाथों से खुद को भी मार देता है।

“कहाँ खो गए तुम?” उसने प्यार से पूछा।

मैंने उसे देखा।
“आखिरी बार हम कब मिले थे?”

वो हल्की सी मुस्कुराई।
“मिली तो मैं कई बार हूँ…”
“लेकिन पहली बार…”
“मैं तुमसे 5 साल पहले मिली थी।”

“और कुछ महीनों बाद हम अलग हो गए।”

“मैं कहाँ हूँ?” मैंने पूछा।

उसने कहा—
“जहाँ शायद तुम्हें होना चाहिए।”

“अब तक तो… मुझे मर जाना चाहिए था…” मैंने धीमे से कहा।

वो थोड़ी देर चुप रही।

फिर बोली—
“शायद मरने ही वाले हो।”

मैं डर गया।
मैं पीछे हटने लगा।

उसने तुरंत कहा—
“अरे डरो मत।”
“मैं तुम्हें नहीं मारूँगी।”

फिर वो बोली—
“मैं तो वो हूँ…”
“जिसे तुम इन 5 सालों से ढूँढ रहे थे।”

और उसी पल…
मैं सब समझ गया।

उसने फिर से मेरा सिर अपनी गोद में रखा।
हाथों से मेरे बाल सहलाए।

और इस बार…
मैं सच में सो गया।

Author’s Note

और इस बार फैज़ल को जो चाहिए था…
वो मिल गया।
जागते हुए नहीं, तो सोते हुए सही।</pre>
