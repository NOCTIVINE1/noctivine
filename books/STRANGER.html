          <p>
            On the night before an exam, she wakes up at 3:13 AM to find a boy sitting on the edge of her bed—silent, steady, like he’s been there before.
            Her phone wallpaper changes. The light refuses to reach him. And he speaks like he already knows her.
            But the real horror begins when she wakes up in a room that isn’t hers… and returns to a life that no longer feels the same.
            Because the stranger isn’t just visiting her room.
            He’s rewriting her world.

It started on a Tuesday.

I remember because I had an exam the next morning and I was still lying there pretending I’d revise in the morning.

Which was a lie.

My notebook was open beside me. Admit card under it. Charger cable twisted the wrong way again. Half empty water bottle near my pillow. My cheap perfume bottle sat on the table like I was still trying to be a person.

I closed my eyes.

Told myself: sleep now.

And then I woke up.

My eyes just opened.

The fan kept spinning. Same soft whirr. Nothing sounded wrong.

Then I rolled my head a little and saw him.

A guy sitting on the edge of my bed.

My tongue felt like stone ...

“Who are you?” I asked.

He turned his head slowly. 

“You’re awake,” he said.

“Yeah,” I snapped. “Congrats.”

It came out sarcastic even though my hands were tight under the blanket. That’s just how my brain works when it’s scared. It tries to act like it isn’t.

He looked at me for a second.

Then his eyes dropped to his wrist.

A watch. Dark strap. Old looking.

The hands weren’t moving.

Stuck at 3:13.

He looked back up at me and said, “You always say that.”

“What?” I asked.

He didn’t explain.

I swallowed. “Get out.”

He stayed seated.

Then he said, “You’re late.”

My brain stalled on that word.

“Late for what?”

His eyes flicked to my phone. “Check.”

I grabbed it and pressed the power button.

The screen lit up.

Relief hit me for half a second.

Then it disappeared.

My wallpaper wasn’t mine.

It was a room.

A cracked mirror. A window with bars.

And on the lock screen there were words.

Not a message. Not a notification.

Just text sitting there like it belonged.

3:13
You’re late.

I didn’t move.

I looked up at him.

“Did you do this?” I asked.

He shrugged. “Does it matter?”

“Yes,” I said. “It’s my phone.”

“You don’t remember,” he said.

“Remember what?”

His thumb rubbed his ring finger once. Like he was stopping himself from doing something else.

Then he said, “You opened it.”

“I didn’t open anything,” I said.

He blinked a beat late.

“You did.”

I stared at him, trying to keep my face normal.

Something stupid flashed in my head.

Earlier that night, my phone had buzzed at 3:13.

Unknown number.

A link.

I clicked it without thinking.

It opened to a blank page and I remember rolling my eyes and going back to my notes.

I didn’t tell him that.

“Leave,” I said.

He didn’t move.

So I reached for the lamp. My hand shook a little and I hated that it did.

Click.

The lamp turned on.

The room lit up.

My desk, my notebook, the floor.

But the light didn’t reach him properly.

Everything around him stayed wrong.

Like the light didn’t know what to do with him.

My mouth went dry again.

He watched my face.

“You see it,” he said.

He leaned forward a little. Not enough to trap me. Enough to make the air feel heavier.

“Why are you here?” I whispered.

His thumb moved again, rubbing the ring finger once.

He didn’t answer right away.

He just looked at me like he was waiting for me to catch up.

“I didn’t choose this,” I said.

He didn’t react.

He just looked at me like that sentence was pointless.

Then he lifted his hand slowly.

I flinched.

He didn’t touch me.

His fingers stopped right before my hair. Close enough that my skin reacted anyway.

A shiver. A pull.

I hated that I felt it.

“Don’t,” I said fast.

His hand froze instantly.

“Okay,” he said.

He leaned closer.

I could smell him.

Clean. Like rain.

Then he whispered my name.

Perfectly.

Not like someone reading it.

Like someone who’d said it a hundred times.

My breath caught.

“How do you know my name?” I asked.

His eyes stayed on mine. Too familiar.

“You say mine too,” he said.

I didn’t feel like I was dreaming.

It didn’t feel like a nightmare.

It felt like a memory waking up.

I hated that thought.

I wanted him gone.

I also wanted him to speak again, because silence would mean I imagined him.

He stood up slowly.

“Sleep,” he said.

“I’m not sleeping.”

“You will.”

Then his fingers touched my hair for one second.
 Warm. Gentle.

And my body leaned into it before my brain could stop it.

I pulled back fast, disgusted with myself.

He watched me like he expected it.

“You always fight first,” he said.

“What do you mean always?” I snapped.

He didn’t answer.

He just looked at his watch again.

3:13.

Then he was gone.

No footsteps. No door. No sound.

The light filled everything again.

My phone wallpaper snapped back to mine.

I stared at the screen.

3:14 AM.

Outside, a dog barked once.

Just once.

I lay back down.

Staring at the ceiling.

Telling myself it didn’t happen.

Closing my eyes like sleep was a choice.

Then I whispered into the dark,

“Come back.”

Next night, 3:13.

My eyes opened again.

Cold air on my arms.

I sat up fast.

Different ceiling.

Different fan.

My pillow smelled wrong.

Clean and wet.

Rain.

I looked around and my body went still.

This wasn’t my room.

Then his voice came from the dark, 

“Good.”

I turned my head.

He was sitting on the edge of the bed again.

Same calm face.

Same watch, still stuck at 3:13.

“Where am I?” I asked.

“Here,” he said.

“No,” I said quickly. “I didn’t…”

“You did.”

“I didn’t choose this,” I whispered.

He leaned back a little.

“You came,” he said.

He reached out slowly.

Not rushing. Not forcing.

His fingers brushed my hair again.

its Warm.

And my body reacted like it wanted it.

The worst part wasn’t that I was scared.

The worst part was that my body didn’t hate him.

I whispered, “I’m not yours.”

He leaned in close enough that his voice hit my skin.

“Sleep.”

Behind him, carved into the wall, were marks.

One line.

Then another.

Then another.

Like someone had been counting nights.

Morning came and I woke up in my room.

My bed. My ceiling. My fan.

My notebook still open beside me.

Everything looked normal,

I sat there for a minute, staring at the pillow.

A single strand of hair 

Not mine.

I picked it up and it stuck to my finger 

The smell of rain stayed.

Hours later, it was still there.

I walked into the kitchen.

My mom was making tea.

I exhaled.

“Mom,” I said.

She turned around.

Paused.

Looked at me like she was trying to recognize someone in bad lighting.

Then she smiled awkwardly.

“ are you okay?”

“Yes,” I said. “Why?”

She hesitated.

Then she said slowly, “You don’t call me mom.”

My body went cold.

“What?”

She laughed like I was joking.

“You always call me aunty,” she said.

Like that was normal.

I looked past her at the fridge.

The family photo was the same.

But my smile in it felt rehearsed.

My phone buzzed in my hand.

Unknown number.

3:13 tonight.
Don’t pretend.

I stared at it.

My thumbs moved.

Not me. My thumbs.

Okay.

It sent anyway.

I won’t wake up tonight.

Which was a lie.</pre>

      <!-- ✅ HINDI (LATEST VERSION) -->
      <article class="story" id="storyHI" style="display:none;">
        <pre class="storyPre">ये सब मंगलवार से शुरू हुआ।

मुझे याद है क्योंकि अगले दिन मेरा एग्ज़ाम था… और मैं फिर भी बिस्तर पर पड़ी थी।
ये सोचकर कि “सुबह पढ़ लूँगी।”

जो कि झूठ था।

मेरी नोटबुक बगल में खुली थी। नीचे एडमिट कार्ड। चार्जर की वायर फिर से उलटी पड़ी थी। तकिए के पास पानी की बोतल आधी खाली थी। टेबल पर सस्ता परफ्यूम रखा था।

मैंने आँखें बंद कीं।

खुद से कहा— सो जा।

और फिर…

मैं जाग गई।

बस आँखें खुल गईं।

पंखा चल रहा था। वही आवाज़।

फिर मैंने थोड़ा सा सिर घुमाया…

और उसे देख लिया।

एक लड़का मेरे बिस्तर के किनारे बैठा था।

“तुम कौन हो?” मैंने पूछा।

उसने धीरे से मेरी तरफ देखा।

“तुम जाग गई हो,” उसने कहा।

“हाँ,” मेरे मुँह से निकल गया। “वाह। मुबारक हो।”

वो मुझे देखता रहा।

फिर उसकी नज़र उसकी घड़ी पर गई।

पुरानी घड़ी। काली पट्टी।

वो चल नहीं रही थी।

3:13 पर रुकी थी।

उसने मेरी तरफ देखा।
“तुम हमेशा यही बोलती हो।”

“क्या?” मैंने कहा।

वो चुप रहा।

मैंने कहा— “बाहर जाओ।”

वो नहीं उठा।

फिर बोला— “तुम लेट हो।”

“किस चीज़ के लिए?”

उसकी नज़र मेरे फोन पर गई।
“देखो।”

मैंने फोन ऑन किया।

स्क्रीन जली।

एक पल ठीक लगा।

फिर मेरी नज़र वहीं अटक गई।

मेरा वॉलपेपर मेरा नहीं था।

एक कमरा था। टूटा आईना। सलाखों वाली खिड़की।

और लॉक स्क्रीन पर लिखा था:

3:13
तुम लेट हो।

मैंने उसकी तरफ देखा।
“ये तुमने किया?”

वो बोला, “फर्क पड़ता है?”

“हाँ,” मैंने कहा। “ये मेरा फोन है।”

वो बोला, “तुम भूल गई हो।”

“क्या भूल गई?”

उसने अपनी उंगली अनामिका पर फेरी।

फिर बोला— “तुमने उसे खोला था।”

“मैंने कुछ नहीं खोला।”

वो रुका।
“तुमने खोला था।”

और तभी मुझे याद आया—

उस रात 3:13 पर एक लिंक आया था।
Unknown नंबर।
मैंने क्लिक किया था।

मैंने कुछ नहीं कहा।

बस बोली— “चले जाओ।”

वो नहीं उठा।

मैंने लैंप ऑन किया।

कमरा रोशन हो गया।

लेकिन उसके आसपास रोशनी ठीक से नहीं गई।

वो बस… गलत लग रहा था।

वो बोला, “अब दिख रहा है ना?”

वो थोड़ा पास आया।

“तुम यहाँ क्यों हो?” मैंने पूछा।

वो चुप रहा।

मैं बोली— “ये मेरी गलती नहीं है।”

वो जैसे सुन ही नहीं रहा था।

फिर उसने हाथ उठाया।

मैं चौंक गई।

उसने छुआ नहीं।

बस मेरे बालों के पास आकर रुक गया।

इतनी पास कि मेरा शरीर अपने आप हिल गया।

“मत करो,” मैंने जल्दी से कहा।

उसका हाथ वहीं रुक गया।

“ओके,” उसने कहा।

वो और पास आया।

उससे बारिश जैसी खुशबू आ रही थी।

फिर उसने मेरा नाम लिया।

बिल्कुल सही।

“तुम्हें मेरा नाम कैसे पता?” मैंने पूछा।

वो बोला, “तुम मेरा नाम भी लेती हो।”

मैं उसे देखती रह गई।

वो धीरे से खड़ा हुआ।

“सो जाओ,” उसने कहा।

“मैं नहीं सो रही।”

“तुम सो जाओगी।”

फिर उसने एक सेकंड के लिए मेरे बाल छुए।

गरम हाथ। हल्का सा।

और मेरा शरीर उस तरफ चला गया।

मैं झटके से पीछे हट गई।

वो बोला, “तुम हमेशा पहले लड़ती हो।”

“हमेशा?” मैंने कहा। “क्या मतलब?”

वो चुप रहा।

उसने घड़ी देखी।

3:13।

और फिर वो…

गायब हो गया।

ना कदमों की आवाज़। ना दरवाज़ा।

बस गायब।

फोन का वॉलपेपर वापस मेरा था।

टाइम— 3:14 AM

बाहर एक कुत्ता एक बार भौंका।

मैं लेट गई।

छत घूरती रही।

फिर भी…

मैंने अंधेरे में कहा—
“वापस आ जाना।”

अगली रात, 3:13।

मेरी आँखें फिर खुल गईं।

हवा ठंडी थी।

मैं उठ बैठी।

ये मेरा कमरा नहीं था।

छत अलग थी। पंखा अलग।

तकिए में वही बारिश वाली गंध थी।

कमरा ऐसा लग रहा था जैसे वो कब से इंतज़ार कर रहा हो।

फिर अंधेरे से उसकी आवाज़ आई—

“गुड।”

मैंने सिर घुमाया।

वो फिर से बिस्तर के किनारे बैठा था।

वही चेहरा।

वही घड़ी— 3:13 पर रुकी हुई।

“मैं कहाँ हूँ?” मैंने पूछा।

“यहीं।”

“नहीं… मैंने—”

“तुमने किया था।”

मैं बोली, “मैंने ये नहीं चुना।”

वो थोड़ा पीछे हुआ।

“तुम आई थी,” उसने कहा।

उसने हाथ बढ़ाया।

धीरे से।

उसकी उंगलियाँ फिर मेरे बालों को छू गईं।

और मेरा शरीर फिर वैसा ही कर बैठा…

मैंने कहा, “मैं तुम्हारी नहीं हूँ।”

वो पास आया।

“सो जाओ।”

उसके पीछे दीवार पर निशान थे।

एक लाइन। फिर दूसरी। फिर तीसरी।

सुबह हुई…

और मैं अपने कमरे में थी।

सब कुछ वही था।

पर मेरे बालों की माँग गड़बड़ थी।

तकिए पर एक बाल था।

मेरा नहीं।

बहुत काला। बहुत सीधा।

और हवा में अब भी बारिश की गंध थी।

मैं किचन में गई।

माँ चाय बना रही थीं।

“माँ,” मैंने कहा।

वो पलटीं।

रुक गईं।

फिर बोलीं— “तुम ठीक हो?”

“हाँ,” मैंने कहा। “क्यों?”

वो थोड़ी देर चुप रहीं।

फिर बोलीं— “तुम मुझे माँ नहीं कहती हो।”

मैंने कहा, “क्या?”

वो हँसीं।
“तुम मुझे हमेशा आंटी बोलती हो।”

फोन मेरे हाथ में वाइब्रेट हुआ।

Unknown नंबर।

आज रात 3:13।
नाटक मत करना।

मैं स्क्रीन देखती रह गई।

मेरे अंगूठे अपने आप चलने लगे।

आज रात मैं नहीं जागूँगी।

जो कि झूठ था।</pre>
